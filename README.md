## MDDN 242 2023 Assignment 2

My inspiration comes from an ancient Nordic script known as the runic alphabet. This script has faded from people's daily lives but remains an important part of Nordic culture. It even had an influence on the birth of modern English. The spirit it embodies and its aspirations for a better life are rich, which has attracted the attention of many linguists, historians, and even mystics. In the Nordic region, people still believe that runic symbols, given to humanity by Odin, can communicate with the spirits of nature and manifest magic.

In this project, I have redesigned some runic symbols while preserving their original essence. Each symbol is controlled by 20 parameters. In terms of animation, I drew inspiration from the movement patterns of nature spirits, allowing the strokes to jump onto the scene in an arched trajectory from the upper left corner.


The 20 parameters per letter:


//1st vertical stroke
  "size_v"
  "offsetx":
  "offsety": 
  "rotate_0": 



//1st horizontal stroke
  "size3": 
  "x_2": 
  "y_2": 
  "rotate_1":


//2nd horizontal stroke
  "size4":
  "x_4": 
  "y_4": 
  "rotate_2":

  
//2nd vertical stroke 
  "size_v2": 
  "x_5":
  "y_5": 
  "rotate_3": 

//3rd horizontal stroke
  "size6": 
  "x_6": 
  "y_6": 
  "rotate_4":
